================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN â€” MCP Server File Upload Support
Language: Go
Goal: Add file upload support to gqlt MCP server for AI agents
================================================================

CURRENT APPROACH: Extending existing MCP server infrastructure
- Build on existing Client.ExecuteWithFiles() method (already implemented in CLI)
- Add file upload support to MCP server tools for AI agents
- Use existing file upload infrastructure from gqlt client
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing MCP tools
- Focus on AI agent file upload workflows

---------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 1 | MCP SERVER FILE UPLOAD INTEGRATION
---------------------------------------------------------------

[ ] 1. Add file upload to MCP server tools
    - Extend execute_query tool to support file uploads
    - Create dedicated upload_files MCP tool for AI agents
    - Define input schema for file upload operations
    - Implement file handling in MCP server context

[ ] 2. MCP server file upload implementation
    - Add file upload parameters to ExecuteQueryInput struct
    - Implement file upload handling in handleExecuteQuery
    - Add file upload validation in MCP server
    - Test file upload operations with AI agents

---------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 2 | TESTING AND DOCUMENTATION
---------------------------------------------------------------

[ ] 3. File upload testing infrastructure
    - Create mock GraphQL server with file upload endpoints
    - Add test files for various file types and sizes
    - Implement integration tests for file upload workflows
    - Test error conditions and edge cases

[ ] 4. Real API testing
    - Test with GraphQL APIs that support file uploads
    - Validate multipart request format compliance
    - Test with various file types (images, documents, etc.)
    - Verify file upload success and error handling

[ ] 5. Documentation updates
    - Update MCP server documentation with file upload examples
    - Add file upload section to MCP tool descriptions
    - Document MCP server file upload capabilities
    - Create file upload best practices guide for AI agents

---------------------------------------------------------------
COMPLETE WHEN:
---------------------------------------------------------------
[ ] MCP server supports file upload operations for AI agents
[ ] File uploads work with real GraphQL APIs that support multipart requests
[ ] Comprehensive test coverage for MCP server file upload functionality
[ ] Documentation includes clear MCP server file upload examples
[ ] Backward compatibility maintained for existing MCP tools
[ ] AI agents can upload files via MCP server tools

STATUS: READY TO START - MCP server file upload support will complete gqlt's AI agent capabilities
